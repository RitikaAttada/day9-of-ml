# 🌱 Day 9 of My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to Day 9 of my ML journey!  
Today, I explored **Linear Regression** using TensorFlow — starting with simple linear regression and then moving to multivariate regression with two input variables. Each problem was modeled using normalized data and real-world scenarios.

## 📘 What I Learned

✅ Normalizing and denormalizing input & output  
✅ Building TensorFlow models for linear regression  
✅ Handling multivariable inputs with `np.column_stack()`  
✅ Visualizing loss and prediction accuracy

## 📊 Simple Linear Regression Projects

### 1. 🎯 Predict Marks from Study Hours
- **Inputs**: Hours studied
- **Output**: Score out of 100
- **Model**: 1 dense layer, ReLU activation  
- **Highlight**: Linearly increasing score as hours increase

---

### 2. 🚗 Predict Car Price from Age
- **Inputs**: Age of car (in years)
- **Output**: Price in ₹ lakhs
- **Observation**: Price decreases linearly with age

---

### 3. 🍦 Predict Ice Cream Sales from Temperature
- **Inputs**: Temperature in °C
- **Output**: Ice cream sales per day
- **Result**: Higher temperature → more ice cream sold

## 📈 Multivariate Linear Regression Projects

### 4. 🏠 Predict House Price
- **Inputs**: Size (sq.ft), Bedrooms
- **Output**: Price in ₹ lakhs
- **Insight**: Both features contribute to pricing realistically

---

### 5. 📚 Predict Student Grades
- **Inputs**: Study hours, Sleep hours
- **Output**: Final grade (%)
- **Result**: Balance between study and sleep improves grades

---

### 6. ⛽ Predict Car Mileage
- **Inputs**: Engine size (L), Weight (kg)
- **Output**: Mileage (km/l)
- **Trend**: Larger engines + heavier weight = lower mileage
